# Atangria (SP 8237)
Atangria is a game engine primarily written for graphics applications. It is a combination of other famous libraries, 
borrowing a couple of features from them e.g. Swoosh, SFML and GLFW.\
Atangria was written against OpenGL +3.0 to facilitate the use of modern Core OpenGL features, 
without using the old deprecated pipeline. The architecture resembles SFML, with the difference that it is aimed to render 2D, but also 3D graphics
in a simple approach.
